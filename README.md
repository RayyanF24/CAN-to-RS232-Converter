# CAN-to-RS232-Converter

Introducing a cost-effective device engineered to seamlessly bridge communication between a CAN bus network and an RS-232 network. This device boasts a minimalist Bill of Materials (BOM) while preserving full functionality. Equipped with three debug Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), including optional RGB variants for enhanced diagnostic capabilities, it offers comprehensive monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities. Featuring dedicated CAN High (CAN H) and CAN Low (CAN L) input pins, alongside Serial Transmit (TX) and Receive (RX) pins, it ensures precise data transmission and reception. Designed to effortlessly integrate with the Roboclaw system, this device plugs directly into the top interface, facilitating swift and convenient deployment. Moreover, it intelligently passes through all unused connections, such as encoder and servo signal pins, via connectors on the adapter board, enabling external utilization while maintaining seamless functionality. This innovative solution epitomizes efficiency and versatility, empowering users with robust communication capabilities at minimal cost.
